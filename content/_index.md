[Doks](https://github.com/h-enk/doks/) is a Hugo theme helping you build modern documentation websites that are secure, fast, and SEO-ready — by default. It [uses npm](https://henkverlinde.com/master-npm-with-hugo-managing-dependencies/) for dependencies management. 

[Doks](https://github.com/h-enk/doks/) is build by [Henk Verlinde](https://twitter.com/HenkVerlinde).

This site shows the use of Doks in book-like fashion, with left-hand TOC
appearing on front page. This is a sandbox to try using several languages with Doks/Hugo,
 which will need a change of both configuration and file structure.
